# Rock, Paper, Scissors!
## ABSTRACT
Welcome to a solution for one of life's biggest problems: no one to play rock, paper, scissors with. This app allows users to play a classic game of rock, paper, scissors versus a computer player who has randomized selections. The app keeps score of both players' wins, losses, or draws. Also included is a difficult version for a next-level experience. Depending on the user's choice between classic and difficult given to them on the app's homepage, the user is presented with an array of fighters to choose from. This choice is compared to the randomized fighter assigned to the computer player. The winner is announced and their respective score goes up by one point. The game resets after a couple of seconds. The user can change game types whenever they like.

## CONTEXT
I am a front end engineering student at Turing, this is my final solo project as required of Mod 1 of the program. The project took a week to complete.

## LEARNING GOALS
- Solidify and demonstrate my understanding of DRY JavaScript.
- Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed in the DOM. 
- Use my problem solving procesesses to break down large problems, solve things step by step, and trust myself to not rely on an outside "answer" to a logical challenge. 

## WINS + CHALLENGES
### Wins:
- Achieving all the required features of the app as specified by project page was the biggest win for me.
- Manipulating JavaScript, HTML, and CSS together to get the project done was fun and a big learning experience through writing my own code start to finish. 

### Challenges
- The biggest challenge was not having someone to talk through the code with as opposed to the paired and group projects done in the past. The biggest challenge is also in a way the biggest win, because this pushed me to really dig deep and do my own research, come up with an answer on my own, and find the right one through trial and error.
- Connecting my data model to the DOM was a big challenege as well. This was especially true when the time came to add the difficult game choice on to the existing code.
